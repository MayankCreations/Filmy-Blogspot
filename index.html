          READERS! I must tell you, this movie watching is so addictive that it
          just keeps you hooked to it for hours. As much as people like to
          restrain movies just from entertainment, more it justifies that movies
          provide us a lot more than. They teach us several minute findings of
          our own society which we ignore on a daily basis.

          Whether we stream them on our laptops, enjoy them in theaters, or
          slide them into DVD players to watch on our TVs, movies are part of
          what it means to be socially connected in the twenty-first century.
          Despite its significant role in our lives, the act of watching films
          remains an area of social activity that is little studied, and thus,
          little understood. In "Watching Films", an international cast of
          contributors correct this problem with a comprehensive investigation
          of movie going, cinema exhibition, and film reception around the
          world. With a focus on the social, economic, and cultural factors that
          influence how we watch and think about movies, this volume centers its
          investigations on four areas of inquiry: Who watches films? Under what
          circumstances? What consequences and affects follow? And what do these
          acts of consumption mean?

          Responding to these questions, the contributors provide both
          historical perspective and fresh insights about the ways in which new
          viewing arrangements and technologies influence how films get watched
          everywhere from Canada to China to Ireland.A long-overdue
          consideration of an important topic, "Watching Films" provides an
          engrossing overview of how we do just that in our homes and across the
          globe."
